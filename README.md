# TEnmoBankSoftware

Project was completed with 2 other members. 

The TEnmo bank software mimicks a banking service which allows you to deposit and withdraw money from an account as well as transferring money in between
existing accounts. When accounts are created, data is created and entered into a database, which is accessed later for banking services. The project
is composed of two main applications, the client side (user interface) and server side (handles database calls and logic).
